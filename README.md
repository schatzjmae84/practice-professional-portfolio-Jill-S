## 💾 WELCOME!!

Thank you for visiting my professional portfolio!  I am currently seeking a job as a full stack software developer, and am very excited to get my creativity out there and start to make my mark out in the tech world.  My portfolio is a single-page application that I created using React/Vite.  The languages I used are JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  I also installed a library in order to use social media icons, and an icon for my hamburger menu.  If you wish to see my professional portfolio in action, please visit the website
