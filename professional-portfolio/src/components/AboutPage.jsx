                <p>Hello!  My name is Jill Schatz, and I am embarking on a new journey as a software developer.  This past summer I completed a LaunchCode Software Development course, where I learned valuable skills in web development, including JavaScript, React, Java, Springboot, and MySQL.  I am excited to apply my knowledge and creativity to build engaging and user-friendly applications.  <br />
                <br />
                Throughout my teaching and personal training experiences, I have always been passionate about using my innate problem solving skills to improve people's lives.  I believe that my unique background combined with the diverse job opportunities that I have been given, will allow me to bring a fresh perspective to any team I join.  I am eager to tackle my new journey head-on!  I also look forward to collaborating with others and to contributing to meaningful projects that make a difference within the community.</p>
